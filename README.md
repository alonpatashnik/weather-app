# weather-app

This app takes in a user input for a city and displays both the current weather for the day and a five day forecast into the future.

The app stores search history and displays it to the user as clickable buttons. The buttons, when clicked, will currently generate the weather and five day for the last city in the list-- I couldn't quite figure that part out yet.

I also could not quite figue out how to get the UV to change color
